Points to note:
	1- cluster numbering should start from 0;
	2- in getWeightedTime, the clusterNumber is used to differentiate between bdry pts of different clusters.
	3- for every cluster, bdry points should have the starting ids
	4- speeds file format:
		num_intervals	end_time	//start time is assumed 0
		dist_of_edge speed(1) speed(2) ..... speed(num_intervals)
		dist_of_edge speed(1) speed(2) ..... speed(num_intervals)
		.	.	.
		.	.	.
		.	.	.
	5- clusters file format is
		num_clusters
		cluster_num of node1
		cluster_num of node2
		.
		.
		.
		.
	6- examples clusters file:
		3
		1
		0
		0
		0
		1
		2
		2
